## Angular youtube embed directive that loads the youtube iframe only after clicking a play icon

I found that other Youtube player directives would slow down my pageload significantly when embedding multiple videos in the same page.
To get around this problem, this directive simulates a youtube player by using the cover image of the video with a play icon on top of it.
Clicking the play icon will load the youtube iframe.
